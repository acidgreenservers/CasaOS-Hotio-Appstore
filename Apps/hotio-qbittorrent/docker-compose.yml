      **Please use the provided pathing in the before install popup, or when clicking tips on the app in the app list.**
      These containers are setup for consistensy with the servarr [**folder**](https://wiki.servarr.com/en/docker-guide#consistent-and-well-planned-paths) setup
      
      **Please remove the container command to create the Downloads folder on startup, after you click install** 
      **This is only required on the very first startup of the application after install
      and will cause the container to keep crashing after startup.**
      If your wondering why the container is crashing, this is why.

      If you want to create more folders in the Media folder, you may have to run "chmod folder-name 755" on the host machine as root
      in order to give the folder proper permissions for these apps

        | Download Path To Set Inside Container | `/data/Media/Downloads` |

        *Please remove the container command to create the Downloads folder
        on startup.
        this is only required on the very first startup of the application after install
        and will cause the container to keep crashing after startup.*

        | Remove this container command in app settings | `sh` |
        | Remove this container command in app settings | `-c` |
        | Remove this container command in app settings | `mkdir -p /data/Media/Downloads && echo 'Downloads Folder created'` |

        The pathing setup is consistent with Servarr best practice
        when it comes to naming folders. 
        This will allow hardlinking
        and other features you want, while keeping the paths also
        consistent with CasaOS.

        Please make sure to set the paths correctly inside the container
        after it is running, before beginning to use the app for production.

        the folders required will get created by the apps when they need to
        create them. 
        Permissions are setup correctly across folders for
        hotio apps as per servarr. 
        
        Just make sure set the folder paths shown inside the containers.
