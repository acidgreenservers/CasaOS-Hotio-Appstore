      📦 Unpackerr is an automation tool that extracts compressed files from completed downloads.

      It monitors download clients like qBittorrent and SABnzbd, automatically unpacking RAR, ZIP, and other archives.

      Designed to work seamlessly with media management stacks, it ensures files are ready for import without manual intervention.

      If you want to create more folders in the Media folder, you may have to run "chmod folder-name 755" on the host machine as root
      in order to give the folder proper permissions for these apps

        | Downloads Path To Set Inside Container | `/DATA/Media/Downloads` |

        This pathing setup is consistent with Servarr best practice
        when it comes to naming folders. 
        this will allow hardlinking
        and other features you want, while keeping the paths also
        consistent with CasaOS.

        Please make sure to set the paths correctly inside the container
        after it is running, before beginning to use the app for production.

        Permissions are setup correctly across folders for
        hotio apps as per servarr 
        
        Just set the folder paths shown inside the containers.
