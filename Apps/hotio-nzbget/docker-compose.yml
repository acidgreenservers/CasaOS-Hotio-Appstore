      📥 NZBGet is a binary newsgrabber for nzb files, written in C++.

      It supports downloading from Usenet servers, with features like queue management, post-processing scripts, and web interface.

      Efficient and lightweight, it's a popular choice for automating Usenet downloads in media management stacks.

        | Name | Value |
        | ---- | ----- |
        | Movies Path To Set Inside Container | `/DATA/Media/Movies` |
        | TV Shows Path To Set Inside Container | `/DATA/Media/TV Shows` |
        | Music Path To Set Inside Container | `/DATA/Media/Music` |

        This pathing setup is consistent with Servarr best practice
        when it comes to naming folders. 
        this will allow hardlinking
        and other features you want, while keeping the paths also
        consistent with CasaOS.

        Please make sure to set the paths correctly inside the container
        after it is running, before beginning to use the app for production.

        Permissions are setup correctly across folders for
        hotio apps as per servarr 
        
        Just set the folder paths shown inside the containers.
