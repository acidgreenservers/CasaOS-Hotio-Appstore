      🎵 Lidarr is an automated music collection manager for Usenet and BitTorrent users.

      It can monitor multiple RSS feeds for new tracks from your favorite artists and will grab, sort, and rename them.

      Lidarr integrates with various download clients and indexers to automate the music acquisition process.

      **Please use the provided pathing in the before install popup, or when clicking tips on the app in the app list.**
      These containers are setup for consistensy with the servarr [**folder**](https://wiki.servarr.com/en/docker-guide#consistent-and-well-planned-paths) setup

        | Music Path To Set Inside Container | `/DATA/Media/Music` |

        This pathing setup is consistent with Servarr best practice
        when it comes to naming folders. 
        this will allow hardlinking
        and other features you want, while keeping the paths also
        consistent with CasaOS.

        Please make sure to set the paths correctly inside the container
        after it is running, before beginning to use the app for production.

        Permissions are setup correctly across folders for
        hotio apps as per servarr 
        
        Just set the folder paths shown inside the containers.
