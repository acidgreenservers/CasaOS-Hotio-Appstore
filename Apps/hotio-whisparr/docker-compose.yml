      🍿 Whisparr is a fork of Radarr designed for adult content, automating the acquisition and organization of adult movies.

      It monitors RSS feeds and indexers for new releases, downloading and renaming them according to your preferences.

      Integrated with download clients, Whisparr ensures your adult media library is always up to date.

      **Please use the provided pathing in the before install popup, or when clicking tips on the app in the app list.**

        | Name | Value |
        | ---- | ----- |
        | Adult Path To Set Inside Container | `/DATA/Media/Adult` |

        This pathing setup is consistent with Servarr best practice
        when it comes to naming folders. 
        this will allow hardlinking
        and other features you want, while keeping the paths also
        consistent with CasaOS.

        Please make sure to set the paths correctly inside the container
        after it is running, before beginning to use the app for production.

        Permissions are setup correctly across folders for
        hotio apps as per servarr 
        
        Just set the folder paths shown inside the containers.
